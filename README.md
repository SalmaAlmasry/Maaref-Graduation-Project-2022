# Maaref-Graduation-Project-2022

Ma'aref is an Arabic Question Answering on Quran and Fatwa, it consists of two parts.

The first part helps people to find an instant answer to their questions in the Islamic religion using Fatwa that are collected from valuable resources.

The second part answers questions about Quranic verses by extracting the answer from the verses given.

It is an honor to mention that we worked on the "OSACT" Qur'an QA competition, and our results happen to be between the first and second place.
